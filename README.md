## Features

- **Smooth Zooming Gestures:** Smooth and responsive zooming functionality, allowing users to zoom in and out of images using intuitive pinch and pan gestures.
- **Customizable Zoom Settings:** With the `minScale` and `maxScale` props, you can set the minimum and maximum zoom levels for your images, giving you precise control over the zooming experience.
- **Reset zoom and snap back:** The component automatically resets zoom and snaps back to the initial position when the gesture ends.
- **Interactive Callbacks:** The component provides interactive callbacks such as `onInteractionStart`, `onInteractionEnd`, `onPinchStart`, `onPinchEnd`, `onPanStart`, and `onPanEnd` that allow you to handle image interactions and customize the user experience.
- **Reanimated**: Compatible with `Reanimated v2` & `Reanimated v3`.
- **Written in TypeScript:** The library is written in `TypeScript`, providing type safety and improving the maintainability of your code.
- **Full React Native Image Props Support:** The component supports all React Native Image props, making it easy to integrate with existing code and utilize all the features that React Native Image provides.

## Getting Started

To use the `ImageZoom` component, you first need to install the package via npm or yarn. Run either of the following commands:

```sh
npm install @likashefqet/react-native-image-zoom
```

```sh
yarn add @likashefqet/react-native-image-zoom
```

ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ Please note that this library is built with React Native Reanimated v2 and uses React Native Gesture Handler. If you haven't installed Reanimated and Gesture Handler yet, please follow the installation instructions for [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation) and [Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/).

## Usage

First, import the `ImageZoom` component from the `@likashefqet/react-native-image-zoom` library:

```javascript
import { ImageZoom } from '@likashefqet/react-native-image-zoom';
```

To use the `ImageZoom` component, simply pass the uri prop with the URL of the image you want to zoom:

```javascript
<ImageZoom uri={imageUri} />
```

```javascript
<ImageZoom
  uri={imageUri}
  minScale={0.5}
  maxScale={3}
  onInteractionStart={() => console.log('Interaction started')}
  onInteractionEnd={() => console.log('Interaction ended')}
  onPinchStart={() => console.log('Pinch gesture started')}
  onPinchEnd={() => console.log('Pinch gesture ended')}
  onPanStart={() => console.log('Pan gesture started')}
  onPanEnd={() => console.log('Pan gesture ended')}
  onResetAnimationEnd={() => console.log('Reset animation ended')}
  resizeMode="cover"
/>
```
